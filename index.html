                            The Pink Tax refers to the hypothesized price premium on women’s consumer goods relative to those of men. We advance the first study to rigorously substantiate the existence of the Pink Tax, documenting its magnitude and decomposing the pink tax into its constituent supply and demand components. Using Nielsen Scanner and Consumer Panel Data, we find that women pay 4.85% more per unit for goods in the same market as do men. This difference corresponds with a 6.67% difference in consumption spending between men and women over the course of a year controlling for income and other demographic indicators. Simultaneously, we find that women exhibit demonstrably more acute price-shopping behavior than do men, paying less for the exact same product (UPC). We apply a CES-demand framework to document that women are robustly more-price elastic than are men, indicating that the Pink Tax is not sustained by markups, but through differences in marginal costs of goods consumed, with women purchasing more expensive goods. We also demonstrate that women’s consumer goods markets feature a wider variety of UPCs than those of men, suggesting greater competitiveness within women’s consumer goods markets, further precluding markup channels in generating the observed Pink Tax.

                            This paper estimates the impact of social health insurance on financial risk by utilizing data from a natural experiment created by the phased roll-out of a social health insurance program for the poor in India. We estimate the distributional impact of insurance on of out-of-pocket costs and incorporate these results with a stylized expected utility model to compute associated welfare effects. We adjust the standard model, accounting for conditions of developing countries by incorporating consumption floors, informal borrowing, and asset selling which allow us to separate the value of financial risk reduction from consumption smoothing and asset protection. Results show that insurance reduces out-of-pocket costs, particularly in higher quantiles of the distribution. We find reductions in the frequency and amount of money borrowed for health reasons. Finally, we find that the value of financial risk reduction outweighs total per household costs of the insurance program by two to five times.

                            Policymakers are increasingly interested in reducing healthcare costs and inefficiencies through innovative payment strategies. These strategies may have heterogeneous impacts across geographic areas, potentially reducing or exacerbating geographic variation in healthcare spending. In this paper, we exploit a major payment reform for home health care to examine whether reductions in reimbursement lead to differential changes in treatment intensity and provider costs depending on the level of competition in a market. Using Medicare claims, we find that while providers in more competitive markets had higher average costs in the pre-reform period, these markets experienced larger proportional reductions in treatment intensity and costs after the reform relative to less competitive markets. This led to a convergence in spending across geographic areas. We find that much of the reduction in provider costs is driven by greater exit of “high-cost” providers in more competitive markets.

                            The high prevalence of coronary heart disease and dramatic growth of cardiac interventions in India motivate an evaluation of the appropriateness of coronary revascularisation procedures in India. Although, appropriate-use criteria (AUC) have been used to analyse the appropriateness of cardiovascular care in the USA, they are yet to be applied to care in India. In our study, we apply AUC to cardiac care in Karnataka, India, compare our results to international applications of AUC, and suggest ways to improve the appropriateness of care in India.

            <p>I am passionate about teaching and have taught undergraduate or masters level courses during most of the semesters I have been at Berkeley.
                The undergraduate classes I have TA'ed for include Industrial Organization (4x), Intermediate Microeconomics (1x), Health Economics (2x) and Psychology and Economics (1x). I received an Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award in 2019. I have taught in person and both synchronously and asynchronously online.
                I have also taught Data Analytics and Introductory Machine Learning and Causal Inference to MBA students at Haas (3x). I developed homeworks and labs in R as well as quizzes and was involved in preparing and developing the course to transition from an elective to a core course.</p>
